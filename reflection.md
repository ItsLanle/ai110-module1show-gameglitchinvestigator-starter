# 💭 Reflection: Game Glitch Investigator

Answer each question in 3 to 5 sentences. Be specific and honest about what actually happened while you worked. This is about your process, not trying to sound perfect.

## 1. What was broken when you started?

- What did the game look like the first time you ran it? 
  - The game looked normal to me, simple desgin.
- List at least two concrete bugs you noticed at the start: 
  - The game shows your out of tries when i had one more left
  - My game histroy was inaccurate (For example, for tries 4-6 it shows my input as 7 each time , when i put in 7, 7.5, and 7.3)
  - The first time i played, i input 12 and the hint told me to go lower event though the answer was 84 and i shouldve went higher.
  - When i lost the first game, it didnt allow me to restart the game using the button and i had to reopen it on a new tab.
  - The answer is shown in the developer debug info

## 2. How did you use AI as a teammate?

- Which AI tools did you use on this project (for example: ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot)?
  - I used Chatgpt to figure out how to clone the fork to my computer in order to open it in VS Code. I also used Ai when i needed to install the game requirnemtns. Because my MAC had pip3 instead of pip, i couldnt dowlaod the requirments with the document command and had to tweak it in order for it to work.
- Give one example of an AI suggestion you accepted and why.
  - One example of an AI suggestion that i took was using pip3 to install the game requirements instead of just pip. This worked since my Mac has pip3 installed and i was able to get past that challenge.
- Give one example of an AI suggestion you changed or rejected and why.

## 3. Debugging and testing your fixes

- How did you decide whether a bug was really fixed?
- Describe at least one test you ran (manual or using pytest)  
  and what it showed you about your code.
- Did AI help you design or understand any tests? How?

## 4. What did you learn about Streamlit and state?

- In your own words, explain why the secret number kept changing in the original app.
- How would you explain Streamlit "reruns" and session state to a friend who has never used Streamlit?
- What change did you make that finally gave the game a stable secret number?

## 5. Looking ahead: your developer habits

- What is one habit or strategy from this project that you want to reuse in future labs or projects?
  - This could be a testing habit, a prompting strategy, or a way you used Git.
- What is one thing you would do differently next time you work with AI on a coding task?
- In one or two sentences, describe how this project changed the way you think about AI generated code.
